# CHANGELOG
The `changelogs.md` file is to track all changes related to `TAVIE`.

---

## Notable Addendum in v1.0.0
- **TAVIE-v1.0.0** comprises the implementation of the tangent transformation for SSG likelihoods as proposed in Roy, S., Dey, P., Pati, D., & Mallick, B. K. (2025), *A Generalized Tangent Approximation Framework for Strongly Superâ€‘Gaussian Likelihoods*, [arXiv:2504.05431](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05431).

- TAVIE comparisons with a suite of competing *black-box variational inference* (BBVI) algorithms like DADVI, ADVI (MF), ADVI (FR) as well as MC algorithm NUTS from PyMC across all the SSG likelihoods.

- Application of TAVIE to U.S. Census 2000 data (performing Bayesian quantile regression) and STARmap dataset (performing Negative-Binomial regression for predicting spatially varying gene expressions).
